## A control-polygon rail authored as a uniform cubic B-spline and baked EXACTLY
## into this Path3D's `Curve3D` (a cubic Bézier spline).
##
## Why this works losslessly: a uniform cubic B-spline converts segment-for-
## segment into cubic Bézier, which is precisely what Curve3D stores. So the
## curve a PathFollow3D walks is mathematically identical to the B-spline you
## drew — no sampling, no error. `levels/rail_follower.gd` consumes the baked
## `curve` unchanged.
##
## Authoring model: you place CONTROL POINTS; the curve flows smoothly near them
## (it does not pass through the interior ones — that's the B-spline trade that
## buys you tangent-free editing). The OPEN curve is clamped at the ends via
## reflected phantom points, so it interpolates the first and last control point
## with a sensible tangent. The CLOSED curve wraps into a seamless loop (pair it
## with PathFollow3D `loop = true`) and starts (progress 0) at the loop point
## nearest control point 0, heading toward control point 1 — so a rig at progress
## 0 spawns at your first control point. (For an exact start, place the wrapping
## control point — the last one — mirrored across P0 from P1.)
##
## Despite the "Nurbs" name (matching how rails are discussed in this project)
## this is the NON-rational case — no per-point weights. Rational NURBS (exact
## circular arcs) would add a `weights` array and bake by sampling; not needed
## for rails, so it's intentionally omitted. The name leaves room to add it.

## The control polygon. Drag these in the viewport (the gizmo), or edit them
## here. The baked rail is regenerated on every change.
