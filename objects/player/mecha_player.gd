## Mecha pilot controller — Star Fox / Panzer Dragoon "aim-led" model.
##
## The reticle is the ONLY directly-driven element (right stick + mouse). The
## ship is a follower: each frame it eases toward a scaled-down version of the
## reticle position, so steering and aiming are one gesture. The camera reacts to
## where you're aiming — banking, pitching, and yawing slightly toward the aim,
## so the world leans as you sweep.
##
## Per-frame order matters: aim → camera → ship → combat. The ship is positioned
## relative to the (now-banked) camera transform, so the camera must rotate
## before the ship reads it. The camera reacts to the cursor *value* (camera-
## local x/y), not the reticle's world point, so there's no feedback loop and the
## on-screen crosshair stays where you left it even as the world banks under it.
##
## Two control schemes share one action set:
##   - Gamepad: left stick L/R flicks the evade; aim is the right stick.
##   - Keyboard/trackpad: aim is mouse/trackpad motion (captured; Escape toggles),
##     J/L flick the evade, Space fires, K toggles the brake.
